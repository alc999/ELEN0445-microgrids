# Goals of this assignment

Learn how to size a PV system installation
- we will use a free tool from SMA: https://www.sunnydesignweb.com/
- we will dive in the details of the PV system installation

Side goals:
- evaluate the potential of the ULiège buildings
- compare to their consumption
- evaluate the benefit of storage

# Sizing to feed electricity to the grid

All the energy generated is fed to the grid at a given fee of 130 EUR / MWh.

Use an all-in cost of the PV installation of 800 EUR/kWp (relatively large installation).

No storage is needed.

## Choose a building

- B28
- B5a
- B7a
- B8
- B15
- B28
- B30
- B31
- B33
- B62

---

## Design the installation using the 3D modeling tool

 - Delimit the surfaces
 - Place a maximum of PV panels

---

## Choose the inverters

 - Organize the PV strings to meet a trade-off between cost and energy-yield (for the amount of PV panels defined previously)
 - What are the constraints to connect the strings
 - What is a polystring configuration?
 - What is the minimal power rating of the inverter you can use for the given amount of PV panels ? What's his energy yield?

#  Sizing with self-consumtpion

 - Get the consumption data from ULiège building assigned to you : https://dox.uliege.be/index.php/s/vp5MYT58xA0ehEu
 - Insert them in SMA sunny design web in a self-consumption design
 - Analyze the difference with the "feed to grid case"

---

# Sizing with storage and self-consumtpion

 - Redo the analysis and determine how much storage power / energy you would need as a function of the costs
 - use costs of 300 EUR/kWh andd 100 EUR/kW for the batteries

---

# Sizing with off-grid mode

 - Redo the analysis and determine how much storage power / energy and diesel generator you would need as a function of the costs
 - use costs of 300 EUR/kWh andd 100 EUR/kW for the batteries

---

# Report

- Write a little report with your observations
- Include SMA sizing reports in a zip (with meaningful names for the different analyses).
